                    The conceptualisation of this project and the entire script
                    is the brainchild of actor Vishal Malhotra who was also the
                    first Indian actor to have released an NFT. 
                  </li>A very small
                    number of NFTs will be minted to ensure the rarity remains
                    high.
                  <li>4 categories of NFTs are available for investors.</li>
                  <li> Platinum, Gold, Silver & Bronze.</li>
                  <li>Each Category comes with its advantages.</li>
                  <li>
                    The NFTs have a ERC 721 contract on the Ethereum blockcahin.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    All collectors of this NFT will automatically become a
                    Producer in this genesis project and will be mentioned by
                    name in the Credit Roll of the Film. 
                    A number of individuals could create a multisig wallet, 
                    in which case the group name would be on the credit roll.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    A premiere will be held in Mumbai to release this film,
                    where we will invite mainstream media and Celebrities to
                    attend this Historical event.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In the long run we intend to become the Go to platform for
                    any individual who would like to distribute or exhibit their
                    films which have been specifically created using crypto
                    currency and NFTs or anything related to the Blockchain
                    world.
